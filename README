KKTerminal

KKTerminal is a simple small terminal emulator for gtk2/3.

Features:
Single instance app, but can be launced in a new instance by using the '-m' switch.
Open multiple tabs at once just give path to directorys on command line, eg:
kkterminal / ~ /usr/share

Open a new tab in current window:
kkterminal ~/Desktop

Execute command in all shells given on command line:
kkterminal -e ls /usr ~ /media

Supports drag'n'drop of files onto tab to paste single quoted filepath.
supports drag'n'drop of text into window ( no quoting ).

Background/forground colours are set in the prefs file here:
~/.KKTerminal/kkterminal.rc
More prefs to come!

The idea of this is to have a small USABLE terminal emulator without all the bloat of other emulators, suggestions, bug reports etc welecome, send to:
keithhedger@keithhedger.darktech.org

I have only just started this project so look for lots more to come.

Why KKTerminal?, just 'cos it matches my editor KKEdit here:
