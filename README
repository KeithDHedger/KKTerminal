KKTerminal

KKTerminal is a simple small terminal emulator for gtk2/3.

Features:
Single instance app, but can be launced in a new instance by using the '-m' switch.

Examples:
Open new instance of kkterminal and list the contents of '/'
	kkterminal -m --command="ls /"

Open /usr and / in new tabs in running copy of kkterminal
	kkterminal --new-tab=/usr --new-tab=/

Open new instance of kkterminal at pos 100,200 with width=800 and height=400
	kkterminal -m -x 100 -y 200 -w 800 -g 400

Bring kkterminal to front ( or start if not running )
	kkterminal

Open a new tab, then run the rest of the command line in a new tab
	kkterminal --tab -e man kkterminal


Supports drag'n'drop of files onto tab to paste single quoted filepath.
supports drag'n'drop of text into window ( no quoting ).

Background/forground colours are set in the prefs file here:
~/.KKTerminal/kkterminal.rc

You can choose to display icons or not in the menus ( in gtk3 ) by setting iconsinmenu	1 in the prefs file.

Prefs used so far:
forecol	white
backcol	black
windowsize	1311 345 382 1142
font	Monospace 10
showmbar	1
iconsinmenu	1

Prefs can now be set from the preferences menu, changes to colours take effect on new shells, changes to menu icons ( gtk3 only ) take place on restart.
More prefs to come!

The idea of this is to have a small USABLE terminal emulator without all the bloat of other emulators, suggestions, bug reports etc welecome, send to:

I have only just started this project so look for lots more to come.

Why KKTerminal?, just 'cos it matches my editor KKEdit here:
